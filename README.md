## ‚ö° Project setup 

### üî¥ Important section 
### (A) Create a Telegram Bot and get a Bot Token

1. Open Telegram application then search for @BotFather
2. Click Start
3. Click Menu -> /newbot or type /newbot and hit Send
4. Follow the instruction until we get message like so
```
      Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/new_bot.
      You can now add a description.....

      Use this token to access the HTTP API: 63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c
      Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

      For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
```
5. So here is our bot token 63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c (make sure we don't share it to anyone).

### (B) Get Chat ID for a Private Chat

1. Search and open our new Telegram bot
2. Click Start or send a message
3. Open this URL in a browser `https://api.telegram.org/bot{our_bot_token}/getUpdates`
   - See we need to prefix our token with a word bot
   - Eg: `https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/getUpdates`
4. We will see a json like so
```
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 83xxxxx35,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 2643,
        "from": {...},
        "chat": {
          "id": 21xxxxx38,
          "first_name": "...",
          "last_name": "...",
          "username": "@username",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "date": 1703062972,
        "text": "/start"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
5. Check the value of result.0.message.chat.id, and here is our Chat ID: 21xxxxx38
6. Let's try to send a message: `https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/sendMessage?chat_id=21xxxxx38&text=Successfully Done`
7. When we set the bot token and chat id correctly, the message test123 should be arrived on our Telegram bot chat.

### (C) Get Chat ID for a Channel

1. Add our Telegram bot into a channel
2. Send a message to the channel
3. Open this URL `https://api.telegram.org/bot{our_bot_token}/getUpdates`
4. We will see a json like so
```
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 838xxxx36,
      "channel_post": {...},
        "chat": {
          "id": -1001xxxxxx062,
          "title": "....",

        },
        "date": 1703065989,
        "text": "test"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
5. Check the value of result.0.channel_post.chat.id, and here is our Chat ID: -1001xxxxxx062
6. Let's try to send a message: `https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/sendMessage?chat_id=-1001xxxxxx062&text=Successfully Done`
